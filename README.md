I apologize for this being so late, truth is after pushing it back several times, I just completely forgot to submit it.

There is a bug when the game asks you to play again where no matter what you type, it prints the line that its invalid. It still functions, it just prints that line for some reason. It has something to do with my input validation for the getting the player to say y or n. I tinkered with it quite a bit, but ultimately since it didn't effect the program's functionability, I just left it alone.
